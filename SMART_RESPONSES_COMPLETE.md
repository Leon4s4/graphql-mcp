## Usage Examples

### Enhanced Schema Introspection
```csharp
// Get comprehensive schema with examples and recommendations
var result = await SchemaIntrospectionTools.IntrospectSchemaComprehensive(
    endpointName: "api",
    includeExamples: true,
    includePerformance: true,
    maxExamples: 5,
    includeSecurity: true
);
```

### Smart Query Execution
```csharp
// Execute with comprehensive analysis and suggestions
var result = await QueryGraphQlMcpTool.QueryGraphQLComprehensive(
    query: "query { users { id name email } }",
    endpointName: "api",
    includeSuggestions: true,
    includeMetrics: true,
    includeSchemaContext: true
);
```

### Intelligent Error Analysis
```csharp
// Get comprehensive error analysis with solutions
var result = await ErrorExplainerTools.ExplainErrorComprehensive(
    errorText: "Cannot query field 'invalid' on type 'User'",
    query: "query { users { invalid } }",
    includeSolutions: true,
    includeDebugWorkflow: true
);
```

### Batch Operations
```csharp
// Execute multiple operations with cross-analysis
var operations = JsonSerializer.Serialize(new[]
{
    new { query = "query { users { id name } }" },
    new { query = "query { posts { id title } }" }
});

var result = await SmartBatchOperationsTool.ExecuteBatchOperations(
    operationsJson: operations,
    endpointName: "api",
    maxConcurrency: 5,
    includePerformanceAnalysis: true
);
```

## Backward Compatibility ‚úÖ

All original tool methods remain available:
- `IntrospectSchema` ‚Üí Basic schema introspection
- `QueryGraphQl` ‚Üí Basic query execution  
- `AnalyzeQuery` ‚Üí Basic query analysis
- `BuildSmartQuery` ‚Üí Basic query building
- `ExplainError` ‚Üí Basic error explanation

New comprehensive methods provide enhanced functionality while maintaining compatibility.

## Response Format

All enhanced tools return structured JSON responses with consistent format:
