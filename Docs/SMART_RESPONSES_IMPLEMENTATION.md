var result = await SchemaIntrospectionTools.IntrospectSchemaComprehensive(
    endpointName: "api",
    includeExamples: true,
    includePerformance: true,
    maxExamples: 5,
    includeSecurity: true
);
```

### Smart Query Execution
```csharp
// Returns execution results with analysis and suggestions
var result = await QueryGraphQlMcpTool.QueryGraphQLComprehensive(
    query: "query { users { id name email } }",
    endpointName: "api",
    includeSuggestions: true,
    includeMetrics: true,
    includeSchemaContext: true
);
```

### Intelligent Query Building
```csharp
// Returns multiple query variations with optimization recommendations
var result = await AutomaticQueryBuilderTool.BuildSmartQueryComprehensive(
    endpointName: "api",
    operationName: "users",
    includeVariations: true,
    includeOptimization: true,
    includeExamples: true
);
```

### Batch Operations
```csharp
// Executes multiple queries with cross-operation analysis
var operations = JsonSerializer.Serialize(new[]
{
    new { query = "query { users { id name } }" },
    new { query = "query { posts { id title } }" }
});

var result = await SmartBatchOperationsTool.ExecuteBatchOperations(
    operationsJson: operations,
    endpointName: "api",

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- **L1 Cache**: In-memory cache for fastest access
- **L2 Cache**: Distributed cache for shared responses
- **Cache Keys**: Intelligent key generation based on operation characteristics
- **TTL Management**: Smart expiration based on data volatility

### Memory Management
- **Weak References**: Automatic garbage collection for large schema objects
- **Resource Pooling**: Efficient reuse of expensive resources
- **Streaming**: Memory-efficient processing of large responses

### Concurrent Execution
- **Parallel Analysis**: Multiple analysis tasks executed concurrently
- **Throttling**: Smart concurrency control to prevent overload
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits for resource protection

## Configuration

### Program.cs Setup
```csharp
// Add caching services
builder.Services.AddMemoryCache(options =>
{
    options.SizeLimit = 1000;
    options.CompactionPercentage = 0.25;
});

// Register smart response service
builder.Services.AddScoped<SmartResponseService>();
```
