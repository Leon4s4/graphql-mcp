# Schema Introspection Tools Refactoring Test

## Overview
This document demonstrates the successful refactoring of SchemaIntrospectionTools to support both MCP tool interface (endpoint name) and internal tool interface (GraphQlEndpointInfo object).

## Refactoring Summary

### Methods Refactored
1. **IntrospectSchema**
   - MCP Tool: `IntrospectSchema(string endpointName, string? headers = null)`
   - Internal: `IntrospectSchema(GraphQlEndpointInfo endpointInfo, string? headers = null)`
   - Implementation: `IntrospectSchemaInternal(GraphQlEndpointInfo endpointInfo, string? headers)`

2. **GetSchemaDocs**
   - MCP Tool: `GetSchemaDocs(string endpointName, string? typeName = null, string? headers = null)`
   - Internal: `GetSchemaDocs(GraphQlEndpointInfo endpointInfo, string? typeName = null, string? headers = null)`
   - Implementation: `GetSchemaDocsInternal(GraphQlEndpointInfo endpointInfo, string? typeName, string? headers)`

3. **ValidateQuery**
   - MCP Tool: `ValidateQuery(string endpointName, string query, string? headers = null)`
   - Internal: `ValidateQuery(GraphQlEndpointInfo endpointInfo, string query, string? headers = null)`
   - Implementation: `ValidateQueryInternal(GraphQlEndpointInfo endpointInfo, string query, string? headers)`

## Architecture Benefits

### Performance Optimization
- Tools that already have `GraphQlEndpointInfo` avoid redundant endpoint lookups
- Reduces registry service calls from other tools
- Single implementation for both interfaces

### Code Maintainability
- Clear separation between public MCP interface and internal tool interface
- Single source of truth for implementation logic
- Consistent error handling across all methods

### Usage Patterns

#### From MCP Tools (External Interface)
```csharp
// Called directly by MCP clients
var result = await SchemaIntrospectionTools.IntrospectSchema("my-endpoint", headers);
```

#### From Other Tools (Internal Interface)
```csharp
// Called by other tools that already have endpoint info
var endpointInfo = EndpointRegistryService.Instance.GetEndpointInfo(endpointName);
var result = await SchemaIntrospectionTools.IntrospectSchema(endpointInfo, headers);
```

## Files Modified

1. **SchemaIntrospectionTools.cs**
   - Added using statement for `Graphql.Mcp.DTO`
   - Created method overloads for all three main methods
   - Extracted common logic into private `*Internal` methods
   - Made `IntrospectionQuery` a private constant

2. **GraphQLSchemaTools.cs**
   - Updated to use the new overload where endpoint info was already available
   - Changed from `IntrospectSchema(endpointInfo.Url, headers)` to `IntrospectSchema(endpointInfo, headers)`

## Build Status
✅ **Compilation**: Successful  
✅ **Errors**: 0  
⚠️ **Warnings**: 5 (unrelated to refactoring)

## Next Steps
- Other tools can now be updated to use the new internal interface where applicable
- Performance monitoring can be added to measure the improvement
- Consider applying the same pattern to other tool classes as needed
