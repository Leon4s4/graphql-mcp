# Singleton Pattern Anti-Pattern Fix

## Issue Summary

The `SmartResponseService` had a problematic singleton pattern implementation that conflicted with the Dependency Injection (DI) registration system. This caused multiple issues:

1. **Dual MemoryCache instances**: The static singleton created its own `MemoryCache` instance, while DI registered another, leading to memory leaks and inconsistent state.
2. **Bypassed DI**: The static `Instance` property bypassed the DI container entirely, defeating the purpose of service registration.
3. **Inconsistent service lifetimes**: Some tools used the static singleton while others attempted to use DI-managed instances.
4. **Resource leaks**: Unmanaged MemoryCache instances were created without proper disposal.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Static Singleton Pattern

**Before:**
```csharp
public class SmartResponseService
{
    private static SmartResponseService? _instance;
    
    public static SmartResponseService Instance => _instance ??= new SmartResponseService(
        new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions()),
        new ConsoleLogger());
}
```

**After:**
```csharp
public class SmartResponseService
{
    // No static instance or singleton pattern
    
    public SmartResponseService(IMemoryCache cache, ILogger<SmartResponseService> logger)
    {
        // Constructor injection only
    }
}
```

### 2. Created ServiceLocator Helper

Since MCP tool classes are static and cannot use constructor injection, we created a `ServiceLocator` helper that provides access to DI services:

```csharp
public static class ServiceLocator
{
    public static async Task<TResult> ExecuteWithSmartResponseServiceAsync<TResult>(
        Func<SmartResponseService, Task<TResult>> action)
    {
        // Manages service scope and lifetime properly
    }
}
```

### 3. Updated All Tool Classes

**Before:**
```csharp
var smartResponse = await SmartResponseService.Instance.CreateSecurityAnalysisResponseAsync(...);
return await SmartResponseService.Instance.FormatComprehensiveResponseAsync(smartResponse);
```

**After:**
```csharp
return await ServiceLocator.ExecuteWithSmartResponseServiceAsync(async smartResponseService =>
{
    var smartResponse = await smartResponseService.CreateSecurityAnalysisResponseAsync(...);
    return await smartResponseService.FormatComprehensiveResponseAsync(smartResponse);
});
```

### 4. Service Registration

The service remains registered as scoped in DI:

```csharp
// In Program.cs
builder.Services.AddScoped<SmartResponseService>();

// Initialize service locator
var app = builder.Build();
ServiceLocator.Initialize(app.Services);
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Single source of truth**: All service instances come from the DI container
2. **Proper resource management**: MemoryCache is managed by DI with proper lifecycle
3. **Consistent service lifetimes**: All usages follow the scoped lifetime pattern
4. **Memory leak prevention**: No orphaned MemoryCache instances
5. **Testability**: Services can be properly mocked and tested
6. **Configuration consistency**: Single configuration point for all dependencies

## Files Modified

- `/Helpers/SmartResponseService.cs` - Removed singleton pattern
- `/Helpers/ServiceLocator.cs` - Created new service locator helper
- `/Program.cs` - Added ServiceLocator initialization
- Multiple tool files in `/Tools/` - Updated to use ServiceLocator pattern

## Verification

- ✅ Build succeeds with no compilation errors
- ✅ All `SmartResponseService.Instance` usages eliminated
- ✅ Proper DI integration maintained
- ✅ Memory cache properly managed through DI
- ✅ Service lifetimes consistent across the application

The singleton anti-pattern has been completely eliminated while maintaining backward compatibility and improving resource management.
